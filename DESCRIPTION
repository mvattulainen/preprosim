Description: Data quality simulation is needed to check the robustness of data analysis findings and
    learn about the relationship between input variables and output. This package helps to add contaminations
    (noise, missing values, outliers, low variance, irrelevant features, class swap (inconsistency), class imbalance
    and decrease in data volume) to original data and then evalute the simulated ata sets for classification accuracy.
    Simulation runs can be set up with minimal up-front effort and results plotted.
