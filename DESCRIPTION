Description: Finding data quality attributes that have the biggest impact on
    classification accuracy helps to focus data quality improvement effort. Simulating
    data quality problems is also useful in testing algorithms and data preprocessing
    techniques. This package provides initial understanding of how noise, missing values,
    outlier, low variance, irrelevant features, class swap (inconsistency), class imbalance
    and decrease in data volume affect classification accuracy. Little or no parameter
    setting is needed.
